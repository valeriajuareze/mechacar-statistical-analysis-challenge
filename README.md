## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

**Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**

According to our statistical summary we can conclude that the variables that do not provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are the vehicle length and ground clearance. In other words, we can deduce that the ground clearance and the vehicle length have a significant impact in the mpg values.

**Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

No, the slope of the linear model is not considered 0 because the p-value is smaller than the significance level, which takes us to approve the alternative hypothesis.

**Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**

Yes, the linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because our R-squared value is 0.7149 which represents how well the regression model approximates real-world data points, and can be used as a probability metric to determine the likelihood that future data points will fit the linear model.
